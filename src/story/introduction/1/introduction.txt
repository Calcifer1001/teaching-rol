Welcome to this role playing. We're going to create a story using typescript. This will be played on the terminal/command line, so you can feel like a hacker.

In this story, you will create your own D&D character. Since this is a learning project, this character will only have a few features, but feel free to add some more.

For playing this, you'll be requested to type stuff to make choices. Different actions should give different results.

Also, there will be dice, so you may be able to do something epic or to lose miserably.

This will also have a save feature, so you can start from wherever you want.

If at any moment you want to quit, type q and hit enter.

If you understand and agree, please, type m and hit enter.
