I'm getting tired of this shit. So I'll make the following step difficult for you. Feel free to fix it in a more intuitive way.

Now you have to choose which number will be assigned to each stat. As you may know, the stats are:

Strength
Dexterity
Constitution
Wisdom
Intelligence
Charisma

And you are seeing your stats in an array style. So set this parameters by index. 

For example, if you want to set the stats in order, type 012345. If you want the order D W Ch I S Co, then type 405132
